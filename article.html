Convert HTML to AMP
Building a regular HTML page
In the project directory, you will find a file named article.html. This is the news article that we are creating an AMP-equivalent page for.

Copy the entire code from the article.htmlfile and paste it into a new file.
Save the new file as article.amp.html.
NOTE â€“ You don't have to name your AMP files as .amp.html. In fact, AMP files can have any extension you want. It's common to see publishers differentiating AMP pages from their canonical versions by using parameters in the url. For example: http://publisher.com/article.html?amp.
Your article.amp.html file should look like the following:

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>

    <title>News Article</title>

    <link href="base.css" rel="stylesheet" />

    <script type="text/javascript" src="base.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      News Site
    </header>
    <article>
      <h1>Article Name</h1>

      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam egestas tortor sapien, non tristique ligula accumsan eu.</p>
    </article>
    <img src="mountains.jpg">
  </body>
</html>
This is an intentionally simplistic page with common static news article elements: CSS, JavaScript, and an image tag.

Our AMP version of the article is just a copy of the original article right now. Let's convert it to an AMP.

To begin, we will add the AMP library file. This alone won't make your new file a valid AMP page, but we'll see below how the AMP library can help us figure out what we need to do to fix that.

To include the AMP library, add this line to the bottom of the <head> tag:

<script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="amp_favicon.png">

    <title>News Article</title>

    <link href="base.css" rel="stylesheet" />

    <script src="base.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      News Site
    </header>
    <article>
      <h1>Article Name</h1>

      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam egestas tortor sapien, non tristique ligula accumsan eu.</p>

      <img src="mountains.jpg">
    </article>
  </body>
</html>
